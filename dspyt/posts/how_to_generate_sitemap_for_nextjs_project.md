## What is a sitemap?

A sitemap is a file that contains information about your site's pages, videos, and other assets, as well as the relationships between them. Search engines like Google read sitemap to crawl your site more efficiently. A sitemap tells Google which pages and files on your site you believe are significant. For example, sitemap  documents the latest update date of pages, and if there are any different language versions of the page.
