## What is a sitemap?

A sitemap is a file that contains information about your site's pages, videos, and other assets, as well as the relationships between them. This file is read by search engines like Google in order to crawl your site more efficiently. A sitemap tells Google which pages and files on your site you believe are significant, as well as providing valuable information about these items. For example, when was the page last changed, and if there are any different language versions of the page.

## Generating nextjs sitemap

We generate nextjs sitemap with next-sitemap npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-sitemap.
