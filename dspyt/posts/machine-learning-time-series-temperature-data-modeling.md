This post is a write up on machine learning time series python using traditional and established libraries like numpy, pandas, scipy and sklearn. In this post we are making a model for time-series data which we introduced in article

Some of the ideas for this post came from researching for machine learning competition Pressure predictor for Australian based platform Unearthed, where I took 11th place out of 55 competitors on a private leader-board. The company is very strict about the data and code that they provided. You can try the platform in Evergreen Challenges: Evergreen: Exploration Data Science and Evergreen: HYDROSAVER.
