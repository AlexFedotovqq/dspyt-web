The systematic process of obtaining observations or measurements is referred to as data collection. Data gathering enables you to get first-hand knowledge and unique insights into your research challenge, whether you are conducting experiments for business, governmental, or academic objectives. Although methods and objectives may vary across fields, the general data collection procedure is basically the same.

In this article, we will describe how to select a research topic, study technique, and resources for high-quality data gathering on topics that include security, compliance, and authenticity on Ethereum blockchain.

## How to determine a research question

Creating a strong research question is crucial when beginning a new research project. This is an important step in the research process because it will direct your research activity.

A well-written research question possesses several characteristics.

- It should have a precise definition and be free of jargon.
- The query needs to be specific enough to lead your investigation in the right direction. It should provide a summary of an important question or subject you wish to address through research—whether it be a literature review, an experiment, or a theoretical exercise.
- It must be addressed within your constrained time frame and with other resources that are available (e.g., money, equipment, other resources).

## Research Methodology

The most challenging and perplexing choice is the optimal research approach. Choosing a research technique is essential since it will determine the kind of methods you use. If you use the right research approach, you may gather the necessary data and achieve the study's objectives.

In general, there are three types of research:

- Exploratory research: it helps to clarify a problem and may lead to the development of a hypothesis. As a result, it frequently uses qualitative research methodology.
- Confirmatory research involves conducting empirical tests to verify a possible theory or hypothesis. Consequently, it frequently employs quantitative research.
- The mixed-methods technique is used to develop a prospective theory or hypothesis and then test it empirically.

Gather quantitative data if your goal is to test a hypothesis, measure something precisely, or gain broad statistical insights. Collect qualitative data if your goal is to investigate concepts, comprehend experiences, or gain in-depth understanding of a particular situation. Use a mixed methods approach that gathers both kinds of data if you have multiple goals.

## Data Collection Methods

Choose the approach that is most appropriate for your research based on the information you want to gather.

- A quantitative approach is used primarily in experimental research.
- Qualitative methods include ethnographies, focus groups, and interviews.
- Both quantitative and qualitative methods can be used when collecting secondary data from surveys, observations, archival research, and more.

The first method is archival research, which involves accessing records from libraries or data online to comprehend current or historical events, conditions, or practices.

To better understand people's impressions or thoughts on a topic, focus groups are sometimes employed.

Besides, a survey involves distributing a list of questions to a sample of people online, in person, or over the phone in order to understand the general characteristics or opinions of a group of people.

Finally, seek out pre-existing datasets that have been compiled from sources like governmental organizations or research institutes in order to evaluate data you cannot directly access.

## Data sources

To begin with, the archival research on Ethereum blockchain security, compliance, and authenticity might encompass investigation into historical events and their significance.
Researchers may look into the Ethereum blockchain use cases and other financial fields such as decentralized exchanges, taxation, auditing, or fraud detection.
For example, the Ethereum-based smart contracts can be examined for fraud and scam prevention in relation to [OFAC Guidelines](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/office-of-foreign-assets-control-sanctions-programs-and-information).
