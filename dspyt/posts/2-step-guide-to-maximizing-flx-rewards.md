RAI is a stablecoin reminiscent of the early version of Single Collateral Dai. It is solely backed by ETH with a trajectory to an autonomous existence. RAI uses a funding rate to automatically balance market forces and keep itself stable.

[The statistics for the protocol](https://oldstats.reflexer.finance/):

The key element of the system is the funding rate which is either positive or negative. A positive rate is akin to a stability fee, meaning that RAI borrowers pay a fee as their RAI debt increases in value. Whereas, a negative rate compels market participants to sell RAI as it is traded at a premium.
